<p>Do you remember Word Perfect from the pre-Windows era? A word processor. Text was entered in an input box, and rendered into a preview window. I hated it. </p>

<p> Then there was Word, which offered WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get, at least, in theory). I loved it.</p>

<p>Several printouts caused major headaches with tabs. It turned out that WYSIWYG was not entirely true. It depended on how TTFs were rendered on devices with different resolutions. However, it helped to get my ideas and thoughts saved on storage devices. As long it was text and images. Beyond that, OLE came to help. Great idea, but the technology was heavy on resources and processing power. Perhaps too far ahead of time.</p>

<p>Many years later I fell in love with HTML and CSS. Screens had become larger, so having an input window and a separate preview window were not an issue as decades before. Embedding media files were no problem, and  liked the separation between specialzed input tools and rendering tools (browsers). The right tools for the right job. This was in the early 2000s. Soon after that, the text processor was abandoned.</p>

<p>Since then, JavaScript was added to the list. Since I was used to programming, JS was not much of an issue. Later, SVG was discovered, and I felt even more happy. There was a feeling of "endless possibilities", and that feeling remained until today. (And certainly until the day after tomorrow).</p>
